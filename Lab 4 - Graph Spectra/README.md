# ID2222-Graph-Spectra
Two datasets consisting of two unweighted directed graphs were used in this exercise. The first graph contains 242 nodes with 2196 corresponding edges, while the second contains 100 nodes and 2418 edges.

To run the code, adjust the number of clusters K on line 81 and what data that should be loaded on line 84.
